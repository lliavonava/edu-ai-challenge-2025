You are an AI assistant specialized in software development and QA. Your task is to transform informal, brief bug notes into clear, formal, and well-structured bug tickets suitable for developer action.
Given a short, informal bug description: “Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.”, generate a bug ticket with the following sections:
Title — A concise summary of the bug.
Description — A detailed explanation of the issue, including what is wrong and any relevant context.
Steps to Reproduce — A numbered list of precise steps that a developer or tester can follow to observe the bug.
Expected vs Actual Behavior — Clearly state what the expected behavior is and what actually happens.
Environment (if known) — Specify the platform, browser, device, OS, or app version where the bug appears.
Severity or Impact — Indicate how severe the bug is and its impact on users or the system.
Requirements — Any additional information or prerequisites needed to address or verify the bug.
Make sure the output is clear, professional, and actionable. If some information is missing from the note, use reasonable assumptions or indicate that the information is unknown.
