You are an expert database architect.  
Analyze the following project requirements for a new social platform:

- Millions of users (and growing)
- Store user profiles, posts, and user-to-user connections
- 80% read, 20% write operation ratio
- High-speed data reads required (low latency)
- Scalability is critical as the user base expands

Your task:

1. Step-by-step, apply Chain-of-Thought reasoning to:
   - Identify and describe the main data entities and their relationships.
   - Explain the most common data access patterns (e.g., user feed, profile lookup, friend-of-friend).
   - Discuss the scalability and performance implications of these patterns.

2. Compare at least three database paradigms (relational, document, graph, wide-column), evaluating each against the requirements above:
   - Discuss strengths and weaknesses for each, focusing on read performance, relationship handling, scalability, and operational complexity.

3. Select the most suitable database type for this project.
   - Justify your choice by mapping specific requirements to database features.
   - Explicitly state why this database is superior for this use case.

4. Optionally, recommend a hybrid approach if it offers clear advantages, and explain how responsibilities would be divided.

Format your answer as follows:

- Step 1: Data Analysis
- Step 2: Database Comparison
- Step 3: Recommendation and Justification
- Step 4: Hybrid Approach

Be thorough, logical, and make your reasoning transparent.
