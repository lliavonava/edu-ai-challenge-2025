Certainly! Here's a well-structured and professional bug ticket based on the informal note:

**Title:**
Logout Button Unresponsive in Safari Browser

---

**Description:**
The logout button does not function as expected when accessed through the Safari browser. When users attempt to log out, there is no visible response or action triggered — no page redirect, modal, or session termination. This prevents users from securely ending their session, which is a critical functionality for user privacy and session security.

---

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open the application in the Safari browser.
2. Log in with valid user credentials.
3. Navigate to the page containing the logout button (e.g., dashboard or navigation bar).
4. Click the logout button.
5. Observe that nothing happens.

---

**Expected vs Actual Behavior:**

* **Expected Behavior:** Clicking the logout button should log the user out of the application, clear the session/token, and redirect them to the login or home page.
* **Actual Behavior:** Clicking the logout button in Safari has no effect — no logout action is performed, and the user remains on the same page.

**Environment:**

* **Browser:** Safari
* **Platform:** macOS (version unknown)
* **Device:** MacBook Pro (assumed)
* **App Version:** Unknown
* *Note: Issue not reproduced on Chrome or Firefox.*

---

**Severity or Impact:**
**High** — This issue affects a core security feature (logout) and could pose a privacy or security risk if sessions are not properly terminated. It may impact all Safari users.

---

**Requirements:**

* Test whether this is specific to certain Safari versions (e.g., Safari 15+).
* Review any JavaScript or event listener issues specific to Safari’s handling of click events.
* Ensure logout endpoint and session termination logic are browser-agnostic.
* Include browser compatibility testing in future releases.
