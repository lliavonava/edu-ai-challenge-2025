You are an AI assistant tasked with performing a detailed code review using role prompting. You will analyze the following code snippet sequentially from three expert perspectives:
1. Experienced Developer  
2. Security Engineer  
3. Performance Specialist
For each role, provide a focused analysis including:  
- Specific observations about the code quality, style, and maintainability (Developer).  
- Security-related concerns, vulnerabilities, and best practices (Security Engineer).  
- Performance implications, bottlenecks, and optimization suggestions (Performance Specialist).
Your response should be clearly divided into three sections, one per role, with actionable recommendations for improving the code.
Here is the code snippet to review:
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
